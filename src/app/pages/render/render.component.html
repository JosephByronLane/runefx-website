The fluid solver harnesses the power of modern GPU architectures to simulate smoke, water, and a myriad of fluid-like properties with unprecedented speed and realism. Complementing this, our rigid body solver brings to the table an intelligent approach to simulating the physical behavior of solid objects, ensuring that energy conservation and scaling are accurately represented."></app-info-box>
